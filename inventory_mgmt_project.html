									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p>This was my first Java project longer than 100 or so lines of code, and was quite a bit harder than the class roster project. The goal was to build an inventory management system for a fictitious 
										company so that they may better track parts and products. The application had the capability to add, modify, and delete parts 
										and products, as well as a function to associate specified parts with products. I'm a bookworm, so I chose to model mine after 
										a book printing company. </p>

									<p>I was given a UML document which outlined the classes and dependencies. However, I was completely unfamiliar with the Java MVC (Model-View-
										Controller) architecture so I watched a couple videos and took notes on the general structure. With this in hand, I started the project 
										by building the GUI in SceneBuilder. At first I tried to do it in IntelliJ using the SceneBuilder plugin but it was super clunky and 
										unresponsive, so I ended up using the SceneBuilder application on its own and just copying over the controller skeleton.</p>

									<p>After building all of the screens, I built the classes according to the UML document. This was fairly easy and it was just a way for me to learn 
										how to read UML docs, as well as familiarize myself with project structure. Then came the 'real' coding.</p>

									<p>My most painful struggle here was TableViews and how they interact with ObservableLists. I had many, many tough times with not populating the table correctly, 
										accidentally duplicating data, completely losing data...it was rough. But, I learned some important lessons along the way and was finally able to get 
										all of my TableViews working correctly. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>The biggest takeaways from this project were encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and project management. Seeing how these concepts operated on a scale 
										bigger scale than I have ever experienced was incredibly beneficial to me as a student and future programmer. Even more importantly though, breaking problems down 
										into more manageable tasks was by far the biggest lesson I learned.</p> 
										
									<p>As students/new programmers, we hear this adage all the time: "Break down tasks and do them in bite-sized chunks". And honestly, 
										this meant very little to me before this project. But while working on this, something comparatively much bigger than my previous projects, 
										this is where I really started to <strong>internalize</strong> the advice and put it into practice. </p>
