									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p>My biggest project to date. The scenario for this was that a fictitious company needed a scalable system to track their customers and customer 
                                        appointments. They needed to be able to create, read, update, and delete both customers <strong>and</strong> appointments with this system, and 
                                        this company operated in different countries so they had to see things in their local time zones. For this project, I had to learn the Java DAO 
                                        design pattern and reinforce my foundation of the MVC architecture.</p>

									<p>With the <a href="inventory_mgmt_project.html" target="_blank"> inventory management project</a> under my belt, the assumption 
                                        was that I learned how to design and build Java programs. The assumption was...inaccurate.</p>

									<p>There's a world of difference between having a UML diagram handed to you, and building one on your own, plus adding another huge 
                                        component into it. This huge component was the JDBC (Java database connectivity) API which, when combined with the DAO design pattern, 
                                        essentially allows a Java program to perform CRUD operations in a database. The database in this instance was MySQL, which I was a little 
                                        familiar with before this class.</p>

									<p>Setting up the driver and path variables was somewhat simple, but that's really where the easy stuff ended. I tried maybe a dozen different 
                                        project configurations before settling on a modified DAO/MVC hybrid; I created a Queries class where I housed almost all SQL operations and 
                                        used methods in the controller classes to initiate the CRUD operations based on GUI input. Something interesting I learned here as well was 
                                        designing to prevent SQL injection. After all of this, I build about 90% of the GUI. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Actually coding this was a nightmare at times, but overall, it really wasn't that bad and I learned so much. The biggest issue I had was with 
                                        Java dates and times. The MySQL database stored times in UTC/GMT, but the application had to be set up to determine the user's locale by reading 
                                        their system settings, then display all times in the user's time zone. This means times in the TableViews and in the drop-down menus (when a user 
                                        creates a new appointment) had to be in the user's local time. </p>

                                    <p>As if working with LocalDateTime and ZonedDateTime wasn't tough enough, there were also small logical and ancillary functions to write. I had to write 
                                        logical checks to ensure no appointments overlapped, provide secondary language support for our fictional French-Canadian users, and write each 
                                        successful and unsucessful login to a log.</p>

                                    <p>I'll say it again, though: this project was a beast but I'm incredibly proud of it. The code is far from perfect, but I learned so much about Java and
                                        designing programs, and it was a nice intro to working indirectly with databases.</p>
