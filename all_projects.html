									<h3 class="major">Projects Overview</h3>
									<p>These are all projects I've completed in the early days of my learning. I've found that I prefer Java so far, though I've seen about 1% of the development world so 
										grain of salt and all that. C++ was fine, but Python is weird and coding in it feels like I'm doing something wrong the whole time. Not wrong like mistakes (though
										there are plenty of those to go around!), but 'wrong' like illegal! I suppose it's just something I'll have to get used to.</p>

									<p>Back to the projects. These projects increase in difficulty from the simple, console C++ Student Roster application to the monstrous (for a beginner) Appointment 
										Management application. My main goal with each of these was to focus on OOP principles such as encapsulation and inheritance. I'll be refactoring the 
										code as I learn more, and I'm tossing around the idea of developing them into mobile apps when I have time to learn frameworks. Right now though, school 
										takes precedence.</p>

									<p>As a side note, it's really interesting to see the skill progresssion that one can make with coding. The Student Roster application took me three 
										weeks to build and afterward, I was really worried that the next two Java projects would take me months (they have a notorious reputation at my 
										university). Then, the Inventory Management application took three weeks, which was surprising given that it required building a graphical user 
										interface with JavaFX. And finally, the Schedule Management application took three weeks. And again, this was surprising because it was much bigger than 
										the inventory system in sheer lines of code, <strong>and</strong> it also required me to work with JDBC and SQL. </p>

									<p>So, scroll down and check them out if you're interested! You can always contact me on LinkedIn if you have any questions or would like to discuss these 
										projects.</p>
