									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p>This simple C++ console application was my first university assignment. I went into this with somewhat of a foundation in OOP 
                                        concepts but very little experience in applying those concepts. </p>

									<p>To start, I did the C++ tutorial over at W3Schools to learn C++. The tutorial was easy. Applying the lessons was not. I found 
                                        C++ to be fairly intuitive though, which helped a little.</p>

									<p>I struggled with header files a lot. My only programming 'experience' was building very small Java console applications to prep
                                        for university, so something with more than one file was completely new to me. I ended up taking an afternoon to ready about 
                                        header files and to see some examples of them, and this helped quite a bit. </p>

									<p>More than anything though, I think learning how to use the debugger to identify errors/bugs was a tremendous investment. Like any 
                                        newbie, I at first would just throw code at the wall to see what stuck. This costed me more hours than I care to admit, and I had little 
                                        progress doing this. Luckily for me, my professor took an hour to review my code, debug, and lead me in the right directions. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>This application also used a lot of pointers. Having the console display the information instead of the data's memory address took a lot of 
                                        effort, but it works now. I also learned how to parse strings here, which is a very useful skill.</p>
